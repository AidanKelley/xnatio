.. _subjectdata:

the SubjectData class
=====================
This class, which inherits from xnatio.Data, manages the data of subjects (specifically ones from an XNAT database--but any subject with an ID should work),
and provides methods for selecting certain subjects to collect their experiment data, both by grouping subjects based on qualitative parameters or by selecting subject ID.
